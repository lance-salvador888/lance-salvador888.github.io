### Planned features
- Music functionality 
- GPT chatbot command
- Time based message purging <i>(i.e. get rid of all messages in the past 15 minutes)</i> to make clearing out my code testing channel easier


### Things I've learnt
- Error handling in Rust is a lot easier compared to other languages
- Integrating methods from external development libraries in Rust (crates.io)
- Finding the primary/accent color used in an image
- Structure of a Discord embed
