Meet <b>[the fish](https://github.com/lance-salvador888/the-fish)</b>, a Discord Bot I built to learn more about the Rust Programming Language, API interaction and bot applications.

### Building the fish
While most of the fish's other commands are generally self explanatory and were pretty straight-forward to build, the most complex part of building 'fish' was making the `~pp` command; which was made to be used by players of the free online rhythm game [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/). 

The command takes a link to a 'beatmap' <i>(that's what the different user-generated levels are called)</i>, and the fish replies with an embed displaying the highest amount of Performance Points (PP) you could gain from clearing that beatmap - along with various other bits of information.  

The hardest problem I ran into developing the command is that it took me the longest while to find a method in a library's documentation that returned a specific data type I needed - because the naming of the method lead me to believe it functioned different from what it actually was for. 

The experience ultimately taught me to think outside of the box more, and that some methods may do things other than their name suggests.

### Other things I learnt
- Using crates.io to implement external Rust libraries and their methods
- Finding the primary/accent color used in an image
- Structure of a Discord embed

### Planned features
- Music functionality 
- GPT chatbot command
- File ext. conversion for video files (e.g. .mkv -> mp4)
- Time based message purging <i>(e.g. get rid of all messages in the past 15 minutes)</i> to make clearing out my code testing channel easier
