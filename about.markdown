Hi! My name is Lance. I'm a graduate of the Object-Oriented Software Developer program at <a href="https://www.sait.ca/">SAIT</a> and I'm eager to learn more about & get into the tech industry. <br><br>
This site mainly acts as a portfolio for my past & current projects of which I find worthy enough to display here.<br><br> 
Enjoy your stay!
